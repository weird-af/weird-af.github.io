    <h2>OSI model</h2>
    <p>osi consist of 7 layers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Application
        </li>
        <p>
            It works almost exclusively with applications, providing an interface for them to use in order to transmit data.when data is passed to application layer, it pass that to presentation layer.
        </p>
        <li>
            Presentation
        </li>
        <p>
            the data is recieved from application layer and The presentation layer translates the data into a standardised format, as well as handling any encryption, compression or other transformations to the data and the pass it to session.
        </p>
        <li>
            Session
        </li>
        <p>
            the session layer try to set up a connection between other computer through a network,it send an error msg if it cant. the job of the session layer is to maintain the connection that is established & the data is passed to next layer.
        </p>
        <li>
            transport
        </li>
        <p>

        </p>
        <li>
            Network
        </li>
        <p>
            The network layer is responsible for locating the destination of your request
        </p>
        <li>
            Data link
        </li>
        <p>
            The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission.the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.the data link layer check whether the data is corrupted dduring the recieve. 
        </p>
        <li>
            Physical
        </li>
        <p>
            this one is near the hardware of computer.here is where the data which transfer over a network are sent & recieved, the main job of this layer is to convert the binary data of the transmission into signals and transmit them across the network.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <div id = encapsulation>
    <h2>
        Encapsulation
    </h2>
    <h4>Q & A detailed.</h4>
    <p>Q. How would you refer to data at layer 2 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model)?</p>
    <p>A. frame <br>bcs Data(Frames), thing...</p>

    <p>Q. How would you refer to data at layer 4 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model), if the UDP protocol has been selected?</p>
    <p>A. Datagrams <br>bcs if TCP was selected it would be segments and for UDP its Datagrams.</p>
    <p>Q. What process would a computer perform on a received message?</p>
    <p>A. De-encapsulation<br>When the message is received by the second computer, it reverses the process — starting at the physical layer and working up until it reaches the application layer, its called De-encapsulation</p>
    <p>Q. Which is the only layer of the OSI model to add a trailer during encapsulation?</p>
    <p>A. Datalink<br>The data link layer also adds a piece on at the end of the transmission, which is used to verify that the data has not been corrupted on transmission; this also has the added bonus of increased security, as the data can’t be intercepted and tampered with without breaking the trailer.</p>
    <p>Q. Does encapsulation provide an extra layer of security (Aye/Nay)?</p>
    <p>A. AYE (yes)</p>
    </div>

    <div id = tcp/ip>
    <h2>TCP/IP model</h2>
    <p>its similiar to OSI model, it serves as the basis for real-world networking, the TCP/IP model is 4 types - </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application</li>
        <li>Transport</li>
        <li>Internet</li>
        <li>Network interface</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q & A detailed.</h4>
    <p>Q. Which model was introduced first, OSI or TCP/IP?</p>
    <p>A. TCP/IP<br>The TCP/IP model is, in many ways, very similar to the OSI model. It’s a few years older, and serves as the basis for real-world networking</p>
    <p>Q. Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Transport layer of the OSI model (Full Name)?</p>
    <p>A. Transport</p>
    <p>Q. Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Session layer of the OSI model (Full Name)?</p>
    <p>A. Application<br></p>
    <p>Q. The Network Interface layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of two layers in the OSI model. These layers are Data Link, and?.. (Full Name)?</p>
    <p>A. Physical</p>
    <p>Q. Which layer of the TCP/IP model handles the functionality of the OSI network layer?</p>
    <p>A. Internet</p>
    <p>Q. What kind of protocol is TCP?</p>
    <p>A. Connection-based<br>TCP is a connection-based protocol.</p>
    <p>Q. What is SYN short for?</p>
    <p>A. Synchronise<br>This request contains something called a SYN (short for synchronise) bit, which essentially makes first contact in starting the connection process.</p>
    <p>Q. What is the second step of the three way handshake?</p>
    <p>A. SYN/ACK</p>
    <p>Q. What is the short name for the "Acknowledgement" segment in the three-way handshake?</p>

    <div id = ping>
    <h2>Networking tools [Ping]</h2>
    <h3>ping command</h3>
    <p>The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible. Usually this will be a website on the internet, but it could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly.</p>
    <p> The basic syntax for ping is ping -target-<br>eg:- ping google.com</p>
    <p>which will return if a network connection availablle on google</p>

    <p>A. 217.160.0.152<br>actually you can see this in the terminal</p>
    <p>Q. What switch lets you change the interval of sent ping requests?</p>
    <p>A. -i<br>type ping --help or ping man for all available options.</p>
    <p>Q. What switch would allow you to restrict requests to IPv4?</p>
    <p>A. -4<br>This forces the ping command to use IPv4 only but is only necessary if target is a hostname and not an IP address.</p>
    <p>Q. What switch would give you a more verbose output?</p>
    <p>A. -v</p>
    </div>

    <p>Q. What switch would you use to specify an interface when using Traceroute?</p>
    <p>A. -i<br>you can see that by listing all the options in traceroute by typing traceroute --help or traceroute man</p>
    <p>Q. What switch would you use if you wanted to use TCP SYN requests when tracing the route?</p>
    <p>A. -T<br>same reason as above</p>
    <p>Q. [Lateral Thinking] Which layer of the TCP/IP model will traceroute run on by default (Windows)?</p>
    <p>A. Internet<br>Traceroute is IP so it would be layer 3 OSI (Network)</p>

    <div id = dig>
    <h2>Networking tools [dig]</h2>
    <h3>dig command</h3>
    <p>The command dig is a tool for querying DNS nameservers for information about host addresses, mail exchanges, nameservers, and related information.The most typical use of dig is to simply query a single host.</p>
    <p>Dig allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains:.use it like this "dig -domain- @-dns-server-ip-"</p>
    <h4>Q & A detailed</h4>
    <p>Q. what is DNS stand for</p>
    <p>A. Domain Name System</p>
    <p>Q. What is the first type of DNS server your computer would query when you search for a domain?</p>
    <p>A. Recursive<br>Assuming the address hasn’t already been found, your computer will then send a request to what’s known as a recursive DNS server. These will automatically be known to the router on your network. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) maintain their own recursive servers, but companies such as Google and OpenDNS also control recursive servers</p>
    <p>Q. What type of DNS server contains records specific to domain extensions (i.e. .com, .co.uk*, etc)*? Use the long version of the name.</p>
    <p>A. Top-Level Domain<br>These lower level servers are called Top-Level Domain servers. Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers are split up into extensions. So, for example, if you were searching for tryhackme.com your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handled .com domains.</p>
    <p>Q. Where is the very first place your computer would look to find the IP address of a domain?</p>
    <p>A. Local cache<br>As mentioned previously, when your computer queries a domain name, it stores the results in its local cache</p>
    <p>Q. Research] Google runs two public DNS servers. One of them can be queried with the IP 8.8.8.8, what is the IP address of the other one?</p>
    <p>A. 8.8.4.4<br></p>
    <p>Q. If a DNS query has a TTL of 24 hours, what number would the dig query show?</p>
    <p>A. 86400<br></p>
